# Employee Research

While working at Pewlett Hackard (fictional), I was tasked to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

# Data Modeling
Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables

# Data Engineering
Using the ERD diagrams create a table schema for each of the six CSV files.

Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.

# Data Analysis
Using SQL code to create tables to answer the following questions:
  1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
  2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
  3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
  4. List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  5. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
  6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
  7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
